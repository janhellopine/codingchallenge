# Hello Pine Challenge for new coders ðŸ˜Ž

</p>Hi there! This project contains some challenges for testing the skills of shortlisted developers and is part of our recruiting process. It should take 30-60 minutes to complete.</p

<p>You will be working with a <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel 9</a> project. The frontend is made of vue.js (through Inertia.js) with tailwindcss.</p>

## Setup

#### Clone the git repository to your machine
<br>

#### Install dependencies
Install dependencies with composer.

```bash
$ composer install
```

#### Database
For the second task, you will need a (small) database to log in. This repository comes with a file-based sqlite database in the database folder.

Copy the content of .env.example to a new .env file and set the absolute path to the database.sqlite file in the database directory.

```bash
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=/Users/USENAME/teamchallenge/database/database.sqlite
```

Feel free to use any database of your choice. 

Migrate
```bash
$ php artisan migrate
```

#### Compile resources

Run the following commands to install and scaffold the resources and listen to changes

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Don't forget to keep this terminal open in order to listen to changes.

#### Start development server

In a new terminal, start the internal php server with

```bash
$ php artisan serve
```

Navigate to the URL (should be http://127.0.0.1:8000)

Feel free to use your preferred local PHP environment (Homestead, Docker etc). 

## Tasks

### Task 1: FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz is a game at which people one after another count up a number,
but each time a number is dividable
- by 3 you say "Fizz"
- by 7 you say "Buzz"
- by both 3 and 7, you say "FizzBuzz"

#### TO DOs
(1) The class `App\FizzBuzz\FizzBuzz` needs to extend the interface `app\FizzBuzz\FizzBuzzInterface`. <br>
(2) Please implement the required methods in the `App\FizzBuzz\FizzBuzz` class

You can validate your implementation with the help of `tests\Unit\FizzBuzzTest`.

### Task 2: Product Browser
Here you will build a `/products` page that displays products from the Shopify Shop `pine-roots.myshopify.com` and lets users search for products by their title.

It should look something like this: <br>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/tbM4prt/Bildschirmfoto-2022-07-26-um-1.png">

The products can be queried using the Shopify Admin API (REST API).

You can access products like this:
```bash
use App\Shops\Shopify;
$shopify = new Shopify();
$shopifySDK = $shopify->getSDK();

$filterParameters = [
    'active'=>true,
    'limit' => 250,
    #More filter parameters
];
$products = $shopifySDK->Product()->get($filterParameters)
```

The filter parameters are described here
https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/2021-10/resources/product#get-products

Please note that you need to be authenticated to access the `/products` page. You can register an account at `/register`.

#### To DOs

(1) Insert the proper config variables from `config\shopify.php` in the *initSDK()* method of `App\Shops\Shopify` <br><br>
(2) Build the `resources\Pages\Products.vue` page. <br>The page needs to contain a search bar for searching for a prouct title and a results area, displaying a grid of products. Each product needs to show at least the following: <br>
    <ul>
        <li> Image (the first image, if none is available show a placeholder image of your choice)</li>
        <li> Title </li>
        <li>Product Type</li>
        <li> Creation Date (please format to DD.MM.YYYY)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/2021-10/resources/product#resource-object displays the available properties.
    </p>

(3) In `routes\api.php`, create an epdoint that resolves to `/api/products` which calls the index() method of `App\Http\ProductController`. Name the route `api.products.index`. *Tip: Don't forget that all routes in this file already have the route prefix 'api/'.*<br><br>
(4) Get the products from the Shopify API. <br>
The requests to the ShopifyAPI should happen serverside. Therefore, the view needs to make a call to the route that we just created in (3). The index method of `App\Http\ProductController.php` should process the request and fetch the products. 
<br><br>
(5) Make sure that the products are loading as soon as the page is loaded and whenever the user enters a searchterm

The `resources\Pages\Products.vue` already shows a basic "blueprint" that you CAN use to save some time. 

## Tips
<ul>
    <li>We are not asking you to adhere to a specific coding principle, but please avoide duplicate logic in your methods and views and write your code as efficient as possible.</li>
    <li>Consider outsourcing frontend components (such as result areas and searchbars) to dedicated components and pass values and events.</li>
    <li>When calling any API, catch and log exceptions.</li>
</ul>
<br>

## How To Submit
Compile the assets
```bash
npm run build
```

<p>Please clone this repository and re-upload it to a github repository of your choice. Submit the link to this repository to us and invite this account (janhellopine) as collaborateur. </p>

Do not submit a pull request to this repository.

## Sidenotes
<ul>
    <li>
    The challenge is not a UX challenge. To save some time, we recommend that you use a snippets from the TailwindUI library to build the results area: https://tailwindui.com/components/ecommerce/components/product-lists (First two are accessible, just click on *Code*)
    </li>
    <li>
    If you are interested, checkout this awesome library from PHPClassic that we are using for interacting with Shopify. https://github.com/phpclassic/php-shopify
    </li>
</ul>
